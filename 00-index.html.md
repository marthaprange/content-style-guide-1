## The LookBookHQ Style Guide

This is our company style guide.  It helps us write clear and consistent content across teams and channels.  Please use it as a reference when you’re writing for LookBookHQ.

This guide goes beyond basic grammar and style points.  It’s not traditional in format or content.  We break a number of grammar rules for clarity, practicality, or preference. 

We’ve divided the guide by topic based on the types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browser in order. 


This guide has been created based on the MailChimp Content Style Guide.  MailChimp made their guide public and invited the world to use it and adapt it as they see fit.  Thanks MailChimp
